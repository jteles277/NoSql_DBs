Redis!


    Simple Commands:

        redis-server            -> Inicialize server 
        redis-cli               -> Inicialize client
        redis-cli --stat        -> Show server status 
        redis-cli --bigkeys     -> Show key numbers divided for types 
        redis-cli --scan        -> Show all key names
        
    Basics:

        Redis is a key-value store (just like a dic)

        Can store from Strings... to Lists and Dics 

        Redis is most used for cache (rapid access memory), for websites, apps, etc.

        Made to use in cluster mode(multiple instances running communicating betewen eachother)

        Redis interaction is limited, using simple commands(Get, Set, Del, etc...)

    ACL (Access control list)

        Security feature that ables the creation of users with permissions and privileges

    Transactions  

        Allow the execution of a group of commands in a single step (all or nothing), they are centered around the commands MULTI , EXEC , DISCARD and WATCH. 
        Redis Transactions make two important guarantees: All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially.
