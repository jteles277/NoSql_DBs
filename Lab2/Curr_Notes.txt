Document DataBases

    Data Model
        

        Structure
            Instance -> databases -> collections -> documents

            Database
                Set of Collections
            
            Collection
                Set of Documents, usually of a similar structure
            
            Document
                MongoDB document = one JSON object
                Internally stored as BSON
                Each document…
                    belongs to exactly one collection
                    has a unique identifier _id
                     
                    Ex: 
                        { _id: "1",
                        name: "Cartuxa",
                        year: 2012} 
                        
                        {_id: "2", 
                        name: "Evel",
                        year: 2010} 
                    
                        {_id: "3",
                        name: ”EA",
                        year: 2016}


            Embedded Documents
                
                Objects inside objects 
                
                - Related data in a single structure with subdocuments
                - Suitable for one-to-one or one-to-many relationships
                - Brings ability to read / write related data in a single operation


            References
                
                Basically isntead of keeping an object inside keeps a reference(id) of the other object/s

                - Directed links between documents, expressed via identifiers  
                - References provide more flexibility than embedding
                        

    Characteristics
    
        + Simpler application code  
        + Schema flexibility
        + Better performance due to locality

        - If the application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing (no joins).
        - The locality advantage only applies if you need large parts of the document at the same time. 
        - The database typically needs to load the entire document, even if you access only a small portion of it, which can be wasteful on large documents


MongoDB: Document DataBase

  $mongo -> start console

  Useful commands:

      show dbs                -> show all dbs

      db                      -> show current db in use
  
      use <db>                -> change current db in use
  
      show collections        -> show all collections of the current db 
  
      db.phones.drop()        -> Deletes collection "phones"

      db.restaurants.count()  -> number of elements in restaurants
